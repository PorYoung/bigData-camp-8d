Growth of Epitaxial III-V Semiconductor Nanowires
主讲人 : Prof. Jin Zou
III-V semiconductor nanowires and their heterostructures have been paid extraordinary attention in the recent decade due to their unique structural and chemical characteristics and in turn potential properties in optoelectronic, nanoelectronic, and sensing developments. In general, semiconductor nanowires are induced by catalysts, which mediates the one-dimensional growth. However, since the complications of catalysts in inducing the nanowire growth, many nanowires induced by the catalysts have their own structural characteristics. In this presentation, I shall summarize our discoveries of impact of catalysts in the growth of epitaxial III-V semiconductor nanowires for the past decade.
主讲人简介：
Professor Jin Zou is the Chair of Nanoscience in the University of Queensland. He gained his BSc (1982) and MEng (1985) from the University of Science and Technology, Beijing. Under supervision by Professor K H Kuo and F. H. Li (both were academia of Chinese Academy of Sciences), he entered the field of electron microscopy. From 1985, Professor Zou helped to establish the Beijing Laboratory of Electron Microscopy, which has been the flagship electron microscopy laboratory in China. In 1989, Professor Zou went to Sydney University to earn his PhD under the supervision of Professor D. J. H. Cockayne (a world leader in electron microscopy and was a FRS fellow). From then, Professor Zou has been engaged his research in understanding the semiconductor nanostructures using electron microscopy. He gained a PhD with Materials Physics Major in 1993 from Sydney University and worked there for 10 years with various prestigious fellowships, including Australian Research Council’s Postdoctoral Fellowship and Queen Elizabeth Second Fellowship. In the second half of 2003, Professor Zou moved to the University of Queensland and continued his research in the field of semiconductor nanostructures, where advanced electron microscopy is an essential tool. In 2009, he has been awarded an Australian Research Council’s Future Fellowship.
Over the year, Professor Zou managed nearly 30 projects funded by the Australian Federal Government or Queensland Government. His current research is focused on the understanding of formation mechanisms the semiconductor nanostructures (quantum dots, nanowires, nanobelts, and ultra-thin nanosheets) and their demonstrated properties by correlating their growth and demonstrated properties with their morphological, structural and chemical characteristics (determined by electron microscopy); formation of high-performance functional nanomaterials and their advanced applications, particular in the fields of Energy, Environmental Protection, and Medical Diagnosis. So far, Professor Zou published over 570 SCI papers with most of them published in leading international journals, which have attracted over 13000 citations and led to an H-index of 57.

Passive, Active and Integrated Safety
主讲人 : 周启峰 教授
Passive safety played a major role in automobile occupant protection by providing advanced restraint systems that have been proved to be effective countermeasures in saving lives for more than 30 years.
In the meantime, with advent of electronic sensors, active safety technologies also advanced in the past two decades to offer added capabilities of safety features for better vehicle performance, thus reducing motor vehicle accidents on public roads. Combined passive and active safety systems lead to integrated safety that possesses even greater potential in reducing fatalities to hopefully bring the “Zero Vision” into realization.
This presentation will (1) focus on briefly refreshing passive safety, reviewing some active safety features currently implemented in production, and providing few examples of design concepts of integrated safety, and (2) discuss future trends of self-driving and/or autonomous vehicles pertaining to regulatory, liability, etc. issues.

Mitigating climate change and ensuring energy security demand cost-effective energy solutions, particularly for large-scale integration of renewable energy sources (RES) to the electricity grid and the removal of CO2 from fossil-fuel power plants. Nanostructures hold the key to such solutions. Clear understanding of “energy-carrier” interactions with host structures is essential to design efficient energy storage systems (hydrogen and batteries), CO2 sorbents in carbon capture and photo-catalysts in solar harvesting. Fundamental simulations are important in probing the specific mechanisms of binding, activation and sorption of gaseous molecules in representative host structures for the design of efficient hydrogen/charge storage systems, as well as sorbents for CO2. Particular attention is focused on the simulation-guided design, synthesis and characterization of graphene/carbon- d nanostructures, with controlled hierarchical porosities, for the storage of energy carriers and capture of CO2, where surface chemistry, texture, defects, dopants and ligand molecules play important roles in carrier sorption, storage, and transport. Different design and synthesis routes will be comparatively assessed for the effective development of practical systems. Important avenues for further study are discussed to speed up the development of clean energy technologies.

In Search Of Novel Power -Split Hybrid Electric Vehicles
主讲人 : Dongsuk Kum 韩国科学技术院
Fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles has been steadily improving over the last couple of decades, and it seems to be reaching its limits. In fact, any OEMs can reduce HEVs that can achieve fuel economy close to the limit regardless of powertrain topologies if constraints on cost (e.g. motor size) and/or acceleration performance are relaxed. Therefore, both drivability and cost must be considered when searching for novel HEV architecture.
Among others, power-split hybrids are known for their high potentials because split hybrids provide a large number of different configurations; twenty four ways of connecting four components (two electric machines, an engine, and a vehicle wheel) with a planetary gear (PG), and more than thousand ways with two PGs. Despite high potentials, finding the best split hybrid was practically impossible due to the large design space. For instance, each compound -split hybrid configuration has three design variables; PG1, PG2, and final drive gear ratios. Recently, the research team at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) evaluated both fuel economy and acceleration performance for all compound -split hybrid configurations and found a few novel compound-split HEV powertrain architecture. Simulation results confirm that the new architecture outperforms all the hybrids on the market from both fuel economy and acceleration performance perspectives.
The focus of this talk will be on how KAIST team was able to find the novel compound-split hybrid architecture, namely the comprehensive design methodology.
